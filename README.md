## 📓 Description

Our project is an advanced movie and actor search engine that utilizes a rich data source from The Movie Database. Our three-person team has been working on this project, using various technologies to create a comprehensive application for searching movies and actor information. We hope that our movie and actor search engine will be useful for all cinema enthusiasts. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us.

## Main features:

### Movies Search:

Our app allows users to easily search for movies by title, genre, year of production and many other criteria.

### Actors Search:

You can also find information about your favorite actors, find out what movies they played in and what roles they played.

### Detailed information:

Thanks to integration with TMDb, we provide extensive information about movies, including descriptions, ratings, casts and much more.

### Intuitive Interface:

Our application has been designed with the user in mind, providing a simple and intuitive interface.

#### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
