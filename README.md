## Description
Our project is an advanced movie and actor search engine that utilizes a rich data source from The Movie Database. Our three-person team has been working on this project, using various technologies to create a comprehensive application for searching movies and actor information. We hope that our movie and actor search engine will be useful for all cinema enthusiasts. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us.

## Main features:
